Module One Final Project - Travel Ta Life
=========================================

---

## Project background

Building a **Command Line CRUD App** that uses a database to persist information. The goal of which is to demonstrate all the following skills:

- Ruby
- Object Orientation
- Relationships (via ActiveRecord)
- Problem Solving (via creating a Command Line Interface (CLI))

The project:

1. Contains at three models with three tables, including a join table.
2. Accesses a Sqlite3 database using ActiveRecord.
3. Has a CLI that allows users to interact with the database as defined by the user story.
4. Uses good OO design patterns.

## Travel Ta Life CLI application

Use my little travel log app to keep track of your trips and create new ones. You can also
specify activities you've done on a trip and write a post about it. Lastly, you can browse the world
with an interactive world map in the terminal, as well as get more infos on a country you're curious about.
